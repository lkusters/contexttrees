Goal: make classes in python that can be used for the tree modeling

Parent class is tree
Then children are full tree or map tree or ctw tree

In this folder:
contexttree : the class
constructtree : parser for calling from terminal to construct tree models from fasta files and store them
comparetrees : parser for calling from terminal to load the constructed tree models and compare them based on divergence
